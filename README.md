The following video will dicuss what are routes and express are and do they work in the Node.JS. The routes allows you to have control over the URL of the localhost.In the  Node.js there is a javascript file, depending on the name, that consist the first variable requiring express and app variable equals to a express function and the last variable known as 'router' equal to the express.Router(); function. In the terminal the javascript file is called using nodemon because node has already been install and display what inside the console. Also there is a code known as "app.use" that is use when routing or watching  over "POST" or "GET" of the localhost and pass off the individual's custom route. When using the app.use, it can be use as the root and helps create the multiple customs to display whatever message inside the console.If using the regular app instead of router.get  you would have to call from how the route was created rather than from the origin router with no method.
